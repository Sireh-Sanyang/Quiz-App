# Quiz App

This website is about a quiz game for cat lovers, but anyone can enjoy it. It has 10 questions and the question are shuffled to make it more challenging. A player must enter his/her username before playing, you cannot play without creating a username. When ever an answer is selected, there are both colors and images indicators to show whether the answer is correct or not. Players will not be able to go to the previous question and if you skip a question without answering it, it'll be counted as a wrong answer.
